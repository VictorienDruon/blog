# Victorien Druon

I'm a software engineer apprentice based in Paris. I work at [Digitevent](https://www.digitevent.com/) and study Computer Science at [UTC](https://www.utc.fr/). I'm building [Loopacer](https://www.loopacer.com/) on the weekends.

I like working at the intersection of product, design and engineering. My goal is to build software that feels obvious to use.

I'm a cyclist. Last year, I spent more than 180 hours on my bike. I last listened to Strawberry Fields Forever by The Beatles. I'm currently reading Dust by Hugh Howey.
